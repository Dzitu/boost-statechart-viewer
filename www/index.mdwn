[[!meta title="Boost Statechart Viewer"]]

Overview
---------

Boost-statechart-viewer is a program for visualization of state
machines written in C++ with [boost][boost]/[statechart][statechart]
library. The program itself is written in C++ and uses [clang][clang]
from [LLVM][llvm] project for analyzing the source code. This program
is released under the GNU GPL license.

Status
-------

- The program can found states and transitions in the source code. Now it also supports orthogonal states.
- The program understands all options and flags as the compilers (gcc, clang, ...).
- State machines can be defined in more than one file.
- The state machine can be inside many namespaces, but not inside templates. 

For compiling and correctly working program it is necessary to have
LLVM and clang version 2.9. We are currently trying to update it for
LLVM 3.1.


Usage
------

The program can be used almost the same way as a C compiler. You will
typically need to specify locations for all header files except of the
files stored in system folder(in Linux: /usr/...) using `-I` option.
Of course you can specify the output filename (`-o` option). Program
displays all diagnostic messages like compilers. If an error occurs
the program stops.

####Example of command line invocation: 

    ./visualizer main.cpp -o graph.dot -I /home/petr/install/

The output file can be transformed into the picture using classical
[dot][graphviz] commands (e.g. `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`) . The initial
state is double outlined. Each transition has a label with the name of
the triggering event.
