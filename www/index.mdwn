[[!meta title="Boost Statechart Viewer"]]

Overview
---------

Boost-statechart-viewer is a program for visualization of state
machines written in C++ with [boost][boost]/[statechart][statechart]
library. The program itself is written in C++ and uses [clang][clang]
from [LLVM][llvm] project for analyzing the source code. This program
is released under the GNU GPL license.

NEWS
-----
- 2013-04-05 The program is working with LLVM and Clang version 3.0 or higher
- 2012-07-11 We have got a new [mailing list][list].

Status
-------

- The program can found states and transitions in the source code.
- The program understands all options and flags as the compilers (gcc, clang, ...). The syntax analysis is done by compiler clang.
- State machines can be defined in more than one file.
- Program provides diagnostics of state machines eg. event usage, missing typedefs for reactions.

For compiling and correctly working program it is necessary to have
LLVM and clang version 3.0 or higher.


Usage
------

The program is plugin for compiler clang. The produced output file has the same name as the input file with source code.
It is also possible to use script that also produces the state diagram in format pdf. It can be also found in repository.

####Example of command line invocation: 

    clang++ -Xclang -load -Xclang visualizer.so -Xclang -plugin -Xclang visualize-statechart -c file.cpp

The output file can be transformed into the picture using classical
[dot][graphviz] commands (e.g. `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`) . The initial
state is double outlined. Each transition has a label with the name of
the triggering event.
