[[!meta title="Boost Statechart Viewer"]]

Overview
---------

Boost-statechart-viewer is a program for visualization state state
machines written in C++ with [boost][boost]/[statechart][statechart]
library. The program itself is written in C++ and uses [clang][clang]
from [LLVM][llvm] project for analyzing the source code. This program is released under the GNU GPL
license.

For compiling
and correctly working program is necessary to have LLVM and clang
version 2.9.

NEWS
-----
2011-08-11 Added support for orthogonal states.

Status
-------

- The program can found states and transitions in the source code. Now it supports also orthogonal states.
- The program understands all options and flags as the compilers (gcc, clang, ...).
- State machines can be defined in more than one file.
- The state machine can be inside many namespaces, but not inside templates. 

Usage
------

The program can be used almost the same way as a C compiler. You will
typically need to specify locations for all header files except of the
files stored in system folder(in Linux: /usr/...) using `-I` option.
Of course you can specify the output filename (`-o` option). Program
displays all diagnostic messages like compilers. If an error occurs
the program stops.

####Example of command line invocation: 

    ./visualizer main.cpp -o graph.dot -I /home/petr/install/

The output file can be transformed into the picture using classical
[dot][graphviz] commands (e.g. `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`) . The initial
state is double outlined. Each transition has a label with the name of
the triggering event.
