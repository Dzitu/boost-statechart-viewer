Thank you for downloading Boost Statechart viewer.

Source files are located in the directory src. To compile them, simpy
type

  make

If you want to use different clang/llvm version, create a file called
Makefile.config in this directory and add there one line:

LLVM_CONFIG := where you have your llvm bin files/llvm-config

This program was tested with LLVM/Clang 2.8.

Enjoy using it.
