Thank you for downloading Boost Statechart viewer.

Source files are located in the directory src. For compilation create file Makefile.config in this directory and add there one line:

LLVM_CONFIG := where you have your llvm bin files/llvm-config

This is necessary for compilation of the program. Compiler needs to be able to find LLVM and Clang header files. And now you can go to directory src and compile the whole application.

Enjoy using it.
